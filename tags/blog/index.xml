      <description>Updates to the HUGONEST blog, including seamless post navigation and the long-awaited ability to move files within the platform. Let us know what you think!</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What&rsquo;s up, HUGONEST crew!</p>
<p>Another day, another round of code wrangling. Kept the momentum going today, focusing on smoothing out some core experiences within the app.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s big focus was on the blogging features. Specifically, I implemented navigation between blog posts. You know, the classic &ldquo;Next Post&rdquo; / &ldquo;Previous Post&rdquo; links you see everywhere? Yep, HUGONEST has that now! Should make browsing through content a whole lot easier and keep people engaged without having to jump back to an index page constantly. Small change, big usability win (I hope!).

<p>On top of that, I circled back to the file management side of things. Remember how you could upload and view files? Well, now you can actually MOVE them! ðŸŽ‰ It sounds basic, but it&rsquo;s a crucial step for proper organization. No more clunky workarounds if you decide a file belongs in a different folder. Just drag it (or, well, use the &lsquo;move&rsquo; command) and boom, it&rsquo;s there. Still more to do on the file manager, but this felt like a necessary piece to get in place.

<p>Making steady progress and ticking things off the list! Always feels good.</p>
<p>As always, I&rsquo;m building this out in the open, so your feedback is gold. How&rsquo;s the blog experience shaping up for you? Any specific file management tools you&rsquo;re hoping for next? Hit me up in the comments!</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
