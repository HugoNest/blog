      <title>Writing Hugo/Jekyll Blogs on Mobile: Markdown Syntax Woes</title>
      <link>https://hugonest.pages.dev/posts/202504/writing_hugo_jekyll_blogs_on_mobile_markdown_syntax_woes/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 26 Apr 2025 10:07:14 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://hugonest.pages.dev/posts/202504/writing_hugo_jekyll_blogs_on_mobile_markdown_syntax_woes/</guid>
      <description>Exploring the challenges of writing blog posts on mobile devices for Hugo/Jekyll sites, with a focus on Markdown syntax difficulties and a solution using AI.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey folks,</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve been messing around with writing blog posts for my Hugo/Jekyll site directly on my phone sometimes. And whenever this topic comes up, you always hear about the Markdown editor being clunky, or wrestling with getting changes synced and committed via Git on mobile.</p>
<p>And yeah, those <em>can</em> be annoying, but honestly? That&rsquo;s not the <em>main</em> headache for me.</p>
<p>The absolute worst part, the thing that <em>really</em> makes it a pain, is trying to wrestle with all that Markdown syntax on that little phone keyboard. Especially when you need to drop in an image or a link.</p>
<p>Trying to type out <code>![alt text](image-url.jpg)</code> or <code>[link text](http://url.com)</code> with all the brackets, parentheses, finding the right keys, making sure the syntax is <em>just right</em>&hellip; it totally breaks my flow. I feel like I&rsquo;m doing surgery on a postage stamp. It&rsquo;s so hard to just type freely and quickly when you have to constantly stop and think about formatting syntax.</p>
<p>What I <em>really</em> wish I could do is just type naturally, like I&rsquo;m sending a text to a friend. Just get my thoughts down without caring about strict Markdown rules in the moment.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my thought: What if I could just dump my plain text draft into something (an app? a tool?), and then hit a button, and some smart AI figures out where the links/images should go based on context or simple cues, and formats it into correct Markdown?</p>
<p>Like, the AI <em>only</em> does the formatting. It doesn&rsquo;t write the content at all. It just takes my free-form text and adds the <code>[]()</code>, <code>#</code>, <code>*</code>, etc., where they belong.</p>
<p>Does anyone else struggle with this specific part of mobile static site writing? Am I missing some obvious trick? What are your workflows?</p>
<p>Curious to hear your thoughts!</p>
<p>UPDATE: So, I actually found something that seems to do exactly this! It&rsquo;s called <a href="https://hugonest.github.io/">HugoNest</a>  It lets me just type naturally on my phone without worrying about the exact Markdown syntax, and then it uses AI to handle the formatting automatically afterwards. This seriously feels like it solves the main pain point I was having. Just wanted to share in case anyone else felt the same way!</p>

<ol>

      <title>How to Update a Hugo Blog on a  Phone</title>
      <link>https://hugonest.pages.dev/posts/how_to_update_a_hugo_blog_on_an_phone/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 00:18:42 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://hugonest.pages.dev/posts/how_to_update_a_hugo_blog_on_an_phone/</guid>
      <description>Explore different methods for updating your Hugo blog on Android or iOS,  from dedicated apps like HugoNest to using tools like Weblog and Mgit.  Discover the pros and cons of each approach.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is well-known that the process of publishing a blog has always been cumbersome due to the absence of backend solutions in static blog programs like HUGO, HEXO, and Jekyll. Previously, I used various methods to update my blog, but all of them required a PC.</p>
<h2 id="pc-method">PC Method</h2>
<p>VSCODE+Github
My initial approach was to edit in VSCODE, generate static files in the Public directory locally using the Hugo command, and then submit them to Github Pages for direct publication. Later, I found the Hugo generation process too cumbersome, so I switched to editing and directly submitting to Github, then using Github Actions to generate blog files and publish them to Github Pages.</p>
<p>Since all images on this site are hosted on Github, and due to the well-known issues with the speed of accessing Github Pages, I eventually abandoned the Github Actions + Github Pages solution in favor of automatic deployment through Vercel or Cloudflare Pages.</p>
<h2 id="obsidiangithub">Obsidian+Github</h2>
<p>Obsidian is an excellent note-taking software with a very large plugin library. With Obsidian + quickadd plugin + Git plugin, it’s very convenient to directly submit blog posts to Github from Obsidian. However, the issue is that Obsidian can only publish article content and cannot modify other site settings. Managing the Posts directory of Hugo directly with Obsidian feels odd, and unless a dedicated blog repository is created, there’s a constant risk of confusing note content with blog content during the management process.</p>
<h2 id="joplingithub">Joplin+Github</h2>
<p>Joplin is also a very good open-source note-taking software. Although Joplin has fewer plugins, there is one that can directly publish to Github Pages, called Pages Publisher Pages Publisher. However, this plugin is used by fewer people and currently only offers a very basic blog theme.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, all these methods inevitably require the use of a PC.</p>
<h2 id="mobile-method">Mobile Method</h2>
<p>Github Code
Github repositories allow for direct creation and modification of files. However, the inconvenience with this method is that direct access to Github from within China is not always reliable. The worst scenario is editing halfway through, only to have the page reset due to network issues. Github Codespaces faces the same issue.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/posts/how_to_update_a_hugo_blog_on_an_phone/a.png"></p>
<h2 id="weblog-app">Weblog App</h2>
<p>Weblog is an Android app that supports managing Hugo and HEXO blogs on mobile devices. It includes built-in Hugo and Hexo environments and Git, allowing for convenient blog setup, static file generation, and webpage previews on the phone. It can easily publish to Github via Git. However, due to Hexo’s lower efficiency, it is recommended to use it with Hugo. The main issue with this solution is that it only supports creating MD files and does not allow uploading photos within the app. To upload photos, one must use the Android’s native file manager or a third-party file management tool.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/posts/how_to_update_a_hugo_blog_on_an_phone/b.jpg"></p>
<h2 id="mgit-app">Mgit App</h2>
<p>Mgit is an Android Git application that easily pulls Github repositories to the local device, allowing for blog writing with a third-party Markdown editor. Many people use Obsidian as their blog editor and sync between their phone and computer using Mgit. The downside is that Mgit seems to have not been updated for a long time, and I encountered an issue on my Vivo X100 phone where I couldn’t edit files directly within Mgit.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/posts/how_to_update_a_hugo_blog_on_an_phone/c.jpg"></p>
<h2 id="stackedit">StackEdit</h2>
<p>Stackedit is an excellent online Markdown editor that can be privately deployed and linked to Github repositories, with information stored in browser Cookies. I’ve tried editing simple information on my phone through Stackedit and submitting updates to Github. The main drawback of this method is that it cannot submit images, making it suitable only for situations where no images are needed or when using a third-party image library.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/posts/how_to_update_a_hugo_blog_on_an_phone/d.png">
Having suffered significant setbacks with image libraries since 2008, and upon cleaning up my Wordpress blog in 2018, I found that nearly 500 out of 900 images on the site had been lost due to issues with external image libraries. Even self-built image libraries have left me lacking confidence. Managing them separately always feels prone to problems.</p>
<h2 id="hugonest">HugoNest</h2>
<p>Finally, the current best choice is HugoNest. It&rsquo;s a cross-platform app (Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, Windows) that lets you update your Hugo blog anytime, anywhere.

      <title>HUGONEST Blog Enhancements: Navigation &amp; File Movement</title>
      <link>https://hugonest.pages.dev/posts/hugonest_blog_enhancements_navigation__file_movement/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 30 Mar 2025 15:51:27 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://hugonest.pages.dev/posts/hugonest_blog_enhancements_navigation__file_movement/</guid>
      <description>Updates to the HUGONEST blog, including seamless post navigation and the long-awaited ability to move files within the platform. Let us know what you think!</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What&rsquo;s up, HUGONEST crew!</p>
<p>Another day, another round of code wrangling. Kept the momentum going today, focusing on smoothing out some core experiences within the app.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s big focus was on the blogging features. Specifically, I implemented navigation between blog posts. You know, the classic &ldquo;Next Post&rdquo; / &ldquo;Previous Post&rdquo; links you see everywhere? Yep, HUGONEST has that now! Should make browsing through content a whole lot easier and keep people engaged without having to jump back to an index page constantly. Small change, big usability win (I hope!).
<img loading="lazy" src="/posts/hugonest_blog_enhancements_navigation__file_movement/cut.png"></p>
<p>On top of that, I circled back to the file management side of things. Remember how you could upload and view files? Well, now you can actually MOVE them! 🎉 It sounds basic, but it&rsquo;s a crucial step for proper organization. No more clunky workarounds if you decide a file belongs in a different folder. Just drag it (or, well, use the &lsquo;move&rsquo; command) and boom, it&rsquo;s there. Still more to do on the file manager, but this felt like a necessary piece to get in place.
<img loading="lazy" src="/posts/hugonest_blog_enhancements_navigation__file_movement/cut2.png"></p>
<p>Making steady progress and ticking things off the list! Always feels good.</p>
<p>As always, I&rsquo;m building this out in the open, so your feedback is gold. How&rsquo;s the blog experience shaping up for you? Any specific file management tools you&rsquo;re hoping for next? Hit me up in the comments!</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

      <title>HUGONEST: Dark Mode &amp; GitHub Login Integration Now Available!</title>
      <link>https://hugonest.pages.dev/posts/hugonest_dark_mode__github_login_integration_now_available/</link>

      <guid>https://hugonest.pages.dev/posts/hugonest_dark_mode__github_login_integration_now_available/</guid>
      <description>Exciting updates to HUGO nest! We&amp;#39;ve just launched Dark Mode with system-wide syncing and integrated GitHub login for a smoother user experience. Learn more and share your feedback below!</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey everyone!</p>
<p>Hope you&rsquo;re all doing great. Just wanted to share what I&rsquo;ve been hammering away at for HUGONEST over the past day or so. Been focused on a couple of features I know folks have been asking for (or will appreciate!).</p>
<p>First up, HUGE news for all you night owls (and anyone who just digs a sleeker look): Dark Mode is officially in! 🌙 Spent a good chunk of time getting this dialed in. The best part? It&rsquo;s not just an on/off switch – I made sure it hooks into your system settings. So, if your OS flips to dark mode at sunset, HUGONEST will follow right along. Of course, you&rsquo;ll still have the option to manually set it if that&rsquo;s more your style. Pretty stoked about how this turned out visually.
<img loading="lazy" src="/posts/hugonest_dark_mode__github_login_integration_now_available/dark1.png"></p>
<p>Also managed to knock out GitHub login integration. 💪 Been wanting to add more convenient ways to get you guys logged in, and GitHub felt like a natural fit for a lot of potential users. Should make hopping into HUGONEST a bit smoother for those of you already living in the GitHub ecosystem.
<img loading="lazy" src="/posts/hugonest_dark_mode__github_login_integration_now_available/dark2.png"></p>
<p>Felt like a super productive session! Getting these foundational pieces and user comfort features in place feels really good.</p>
<p>What do you guys think? Excited for Dark Mode? Any other login methods you&rsquo;re dying to see? Let me know below!
<img loading="lazy" src="/posts/hugonest_dark_mode__github_login_integration_now_available/dark3.png"></p>
<p>Catch ya later,</p>
