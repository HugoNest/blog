      <title>Quitting My Job to Build Something Meaningful‚ÄîWas It Worth It?</title>

      <description>A developer&amp;#39;s journey from a stable but boring job to creating HugoNest, a mobile app for Hugo users, and the determination to keep it free.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Five years ago, I was just another dev working a stable but boring job, building stuff I didn‚Äôt care about.</p>
<p>One day, a friend messaged me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúYo, you heard of Hugo? Static site generator. Fast as hell. Uses Markdown.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I checked it out.<br>
And it hit me‚Äîthis is what I <em>actually</em> wanna build for. Clean tools. No bloat. Full control.<br>
So I quit my job to make something of my own.</p>
<p>A few months later, I launched <strong>HugoNest</strong>‚Äîa mobile app for Hugo users.<br>
You can write blogs on your phone, sync with Git, and even use AI to help you start your posts.<br>
No laptop needed. No distractions. Just you and your ideas.</p>
<p>But real talk?<br>
It flopped.</p>
<p>Barely any downloads. I couldn‚Äôt even pay my server bill.<br>
People told me to quit. Get a real job. Do consulting.<br>
I almost gave up.</p>
<p>Then I saw this comment on GitHub from a dev in South Africa:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúWrote my travel blog on the bus using HugoNest. No laptop. Just my phone. Thank you.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That message? Man‚Ä¶ it kept me going.</p>
<p>I realized HugoNest isn&rsquo;t for the masses.<br>
It‚Äôs for people like us‚Äîindie makers, devs, bloggers who wanna own their work, build without limits, and stay off the big platforms.</p>
<p>So I made one final decision:</p>
<p><strong>I made HugoNest 100% free.</strong></p>
<p>Not because it‚Äôs worthless.<br>
But because I believe in it.<br>
And I believe someone out there still needs it.</p>
<p>If you use Hugo, or you just wanna write your story your way‚Äîthis is for you.</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt know if this will save the app.<br>
But I know this:</p>
<p><strong>Before I walk away, I want to give it to the ones who truly get it.</strong></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>üì± HugoNest - now FREE</strong></p>
<p>Write, edit, and publish your Hugo blog from anywhere.<br>
All you need is your phone.</p>

<p>Every Hugo( or Jekyll) website owner has likely experienced the charm of its efficiency and simplicity. However, when it comes to updating, modifying, or even managing website content in mobile scenarios, that convenience often takes a significant hit. As we discussed earlier, directly operating a Hugo website on a mobile phone faces numerous insurmountable obstacles:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lack of a Proper Development Environment:</strong> Mobile operating systems are not designed for software development, making it awkward to run a static site generator like Hugo that relies on command-line tools and specific environments.</li>
<li><strong>Limited Command-Line Access:</strong> Even with the existence of some terminal emulators, their functionality is far inferior to desktop environments, making it incredibly difficult to execute Hugo&rsquo;s complex commands.</li>
<li><strong>Complex File System Management:</strong> Navigating and editing the directory structure, Markdown files, and configuration files of a Hugo website on a small phone screen is undoubtedly a nightmare.</li>
<li><strong>Difficult-to-Manage Dependencies:</strong> Hugo may rely on Go language environments and other tools that are challenging to install and maintain on mobile devices.</li>
<li><strong>Cumbersome Deployment Process:</strong> Website deployment typically involves Git version control and various command-line tools, making the efficiency and convenience of operating on a mobile device difficult to guarantee.</li>
</ul>
<p>These pain points force us to rely on desktop computers to complete Hugo website management tasks, which undoubtedly limits our freedom to update content anytime, anywhere. Whenever inspiration strikes, we want to quickly fix typos, or simply want to manage the website while traveling, we feel helpless.</p>

      <title>Hugo Mobile Management: Need Your Help Testing Our New Android App</title>
      <link>https://hugonest.pages.dev/posts/202504/hugo_mobile_management_need_your_help_testing_our_new_android_app/</link>

      <description>A tool in development to simplify Hugo blog management on mobile devices.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi everyone!</p>
<p>If you use Hugo for your blog, like me, and sometimes wish it was easier to do simple things on your phone, then maybe you&rsquo;ll find this interesting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been working on a small tool that I hope will help Hugo users manage their blogs easier on their phones. Right now, it&rsquo;s in the very early testing stages, but I think some of you might like the idea.</p>
<p>Basically, this tool (let&rsquo;s call it HugoNest for now) wants to make it simpler to manage your Hugo blog on your phone, so you don&rsquo;t always need a computer. It can do a few basic things like:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Work on different phones and computers.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Help with simple Git stuff.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Make it easier to write in Markdown on your phone.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Have some new AI features to help you write.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Make it easy to add pictures from your phone.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Show changes in the app quickly.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I know that for a tool like Hugo, being stable and keeping your data safe is super important. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve thought about these things from the start (like keeping your keys safe on your phone).</p>
<p>Right now, I&rsquo;m doing a small test with a few people. I&rsquo;d really like to get some real feedback to help make this tool better. If you also use Hugo and are willing to spend a little time trying out this early version and give me your thoughts, I would really appreciate it!</p>
<p>As a thank you for helping me test, if you join our early testing group, you will <strong>get to use this app for free.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you&rsquo;re interested in joining the test, please send me an email or a message with your email address.</strong> I will use your email to add you to the list of testers on Google Play.</p>
<p>My email address is:  <a href="mailto:HugoNest@xgdebug.com">HugoNest@xgdebug.com</a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really excited to see how we can make using Hugo even better together!</p>
<p>Thanks a lot!</p>

      <title>How to Update a Hugo Blog on a  Phone</title>
      <link>https://hugonest.pages.dev/posts/how_to_update_a_hugo_blog_on_an_phone/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 00:18:42 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://hugonest.pages.dev/posts/how_to_update_a_hugo_blog_on_an_phone/</guid>
      <description>Explore different methods for updating your Hugo blog on Android or iOS,  from dedicated apps like HugoNest to using tools like Weblog and Mgit.  Discover the pros and cons of each approach.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is well-known that the process of publishing a blog has always been cumbersome due to the absence of backend solutions in static blog programs like HUGO, HEXO, and Jekyll. Previously, I used various methods to update my blog, but all of them required a PC.</p>
<h2 id="pc-method">PC Method</h2>
<p>VSCODE+Github
My initial approach was to edit in VSCODE, generate static files in the Public directory locally using the Hugo command, and then submit them to Github Pages for direct publication. Later, I found the Hugo generation process too cumbersome, so I switched to editing and directly submitting to Github, then using Github Actions to generate blog files and publish them to Github Pages.</p>
<p>Since all images on this site are hosted on Github, and due to the well-known issues with the speed of accessing Github Pages, I eventually abandoned the Github Actions + Github Pages solution in favor of automatic deployment through Vercel or Cloudflare Pages.</p>
<h2 id="obsidiangithub">Obsidian+Github</h2>
<p>Obsidian is an excellent note-taking software with a very large plugin library. With Obsidian + quickadd plugin + Git plugin, it‚Äôs very convenient to directly submit blog posts to Github from Obsidian. However, the issue is that Obsidian can only publish article content and cannot modify other site settings. Managing the Posts directory of Hugo directly with Obsidian feels odd, and unless a dedicated blog repository is created, there‚Äôs a constant risk of confusing note content with blog content during the management process.</p>
<h2 id="joplingithub">Joplin+Github</h2>
<p>Joplin is also a very good open-source note-taking software. Although Joplin has fewer plugins, there is one that can directly publish to Github Pages, called Pages Publisher Pages Publisher. However, this plugin is used by fewer people and currently only offers a very basic blog theme.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, all these methods inevitably require the use of a PC.</p>
<h2 id="mobile-method">Mobile Method</h2>
<p>Github Code
Github repositories allow for direct creation and modification of files. However, the inconvenience with this method is that direct access to Github from within China is not always reliable. The worst scenario is editing halfway through, only to have the page reset due to network issues. Github Codespaces faces the same issue.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/posts/how_to_update_a_hugo_blog_on_an_phone/a.png"></p>
<h2 id="weblog-app">Weblog App</h2>
<p>Weblog is an Android app that supports managing Hugo and HEXO blogs on mobile devices. It includes built-in Hugo and Hexo environments and Git, allowing for convenient blog setup, static file generation, and webpage previews on the phone. It can easily publish to Github via Git. However, due to Hexo‚Äôs lower efficiency, it is recommended to use it with Hugo. The main issue with this solution is that it only supports creating MD files and does not allow uploading photos within the app. To upload photos, one must use the Android‚Äôs native file manager or a third-party file management tool.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/posts/how_to_update_a_hugo_blog_on_an_phone/b.jpg"></p>
<h2 id="mgit-app">Mgit App</h2>
<p>Mgit is an Android Git application that easily pulls Github repositories to the local device, allowing for blog writing with a third-party Markdown editor. Many people use Obsidian as their blog editor and sync between their phone and computer using Mgit. The downside is that Mgit seems to have not been updated for a long time, and I encountered an issue on my Vivo X100 phone where I couldn‚Äôt edit files directly within Mgit.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/posts/how_to_update_a_hugo_blog_on_an_phone/c.jpg"></p>
<h2 id="stackedit">StackEdit</h2>
<p>Stackedit is an excellent online Markdown editor that can be privately deployed and linked to Github repositories, with information stored in browser Cookies. I‚Äôve tried editing simple information on my phone through Stackedit and submitting updates to Github. The main drawback of this method is that it cannot submit images, making it suitable only for situations where no images are needed or when using a third-party image library.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/posts/how_to_update_a_hugo_blog_on_an_phone/d.png">
Having suffered significant setbacks with image libraries since 2008, and upon cleaning up my Wordpress blog in 2018, I found that nearly 500 out of 900 images on the site had been lost due to issues with external image libraries. Even self-built image libraries have left me lacking confidence. Managing them separately always feels prone to problems.</p>
<h2 id="hugonest">HugoNest</h2>
<p>Finally, the current best choice is HugoNest. It&rsquo;s a cross-platform app (Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, Windows) that lets you update your Hugo blog anytime, anywhere.
