      <description>A developer&amp;#39;s journey from a stable but boring job to creating HugoNest, a mobile app for Hugo users, and the determination to keep it free.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Five years ago, I was just another dev working a stable but boring job, building stuff I didn’t care about.</p>
<p>One day, a friend messaged me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Yo, you heard of Hugo? Static site generator. Fast as hell. Uses Markdown.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I checked it out.<br>
And it hit me—this is what I <em>actually</em> wanna build for. Clean tools. No bloat. Full control.<br>
So I quit my job to make something of my own.</p>
<p>A few months later, I launched <strong>HugoNest</strong>—a mobile app for Hugo users.<br>
You can write blogs on your phone, sync with Git, and even use AI to help you start your posts.<br>
No laptop needed. No distractions. Just you and your ideas.</p>
<p>But real talk?<br>
It flopped.</p>
<p>Barely any downloads. I couldn’t even pay my server bill.<br>
People told me to quit. Get a real job. Do consulting.<br>
I almost gave up.</p>
<p>Then I saw this comment on GitHub from a dev in South Africa:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Wrote my travel blog on the bus using HugoNest. No laptop. Just my phone. Thank you.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That message? Man… it kept me going.</p>
<p>I realized HugoNest isn&rsquo;t for the masses.<br>
It’s for people like us—indie makers, devs, bloggers who wanna own their work, build without limits, and stay off the big platforms.</p>
<p>So I made one final decision:</p>
<p><strong>I made HugoNest 100% free.</strong></p>
<p>Not because it’s worthless.<br>
But because I believe in it.<br>
And I believe someone out there still needs it.</p>
<p>If you use Hugo, or you just wanna write your story your way—this is for you.</p>
<p>I don’t know if this will save the app.<br>
But I know this:</p>
<p><strong>Before I walk away, I want to give it to the ones who truly get it.</strong></p>
