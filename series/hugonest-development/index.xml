      <description>Catch up on the latest updates for HugoNest, including a new onboarding guide, enhanced AI formatting, and improved backend security. Your boy&amp;#39;s been grindin&amp;#39;!</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Aight fam, quick update on what your boy been workin&rsquo; on for HugoNest the last couple days. Been grindin'.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Newbie Guide is LIVE:</strong> First off, gotta look out for the new folks, right? Dropped a new onboarding guide in the app. Should make jumpin&rsquo; in way smoother, show you the ropes so you ain&rsquo;t gotta guess. Gettin&rsquo; y&rsquo;all set up proper. ‚ú®</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>AI Formatting Got That Glow Up:</strong> That AI helpin&rsquo; you format posts? Yeah, gave it a tune-up. It&rsquo;s way better now at makin&rsquo; your stuff look clean without you havin&rsquo; to sweat the small stuff. Should be smarter, less hassle. üí™</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>AI Backend Secured:</strong> Moved the AI brain over to Cloudflare, you know, for that speed and stability. BUT also locked it down with some verification. Can&rsquo;t have bots runnin&rsquo; wild and messin&rsquo; things up, feel me? Keepin&rsquo; the playground clean. üîí</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Recent Posts Make Sense Now:</strong> Real talk, that &lsquo;Recent Posts&rsquo; list was kinda buggin&rsquo;. Fixed it so now it sorts by the <em>last time you actually edited</em> somethin&rsquo;. Makes way more sense for findin&rsquo; that draft you were just workin&rsquo; on. Should be less diggin&rsquo;. üíØ</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>That&rsquo;s the quick rundown. Puttin&rsquo; in work to make HugoNest solid for y&rsquo;all.</p>
<p>Lemme know what you think. Back to the code cave. Peace! ‚úåÔ∏è</p>

      <title>HUGONEST Blog Enhancements: Navigation &amp; File Movement</title>
      <link>https://hugonest.pages.dev/posts/hugonest_blog_enhancements_navigation__file_movement/</link>

      <description>Updates to the HUGONEST blog, including seamless post navigation and the long-awaited ability to move files within the platform. Let us know what you think!</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What&rsquo;s up, HUGONEST crew!</p>
<p>Another day, another round of code wrangling. Kept the momentum going today, focusing on smoothing out some core experiences within the app.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s big focus was on the blogging features. Specifically, I implemented navigation between blog posts. You know, the classic &ldquo;Next Post&rdquo; / &ldquo;Previous Post&rdquo; links you see everywhere? Yep, HUGONEST has that now! Should make browsing through content a whole lot easier and keep people engaged without having to jump back to an index page constantly. Small change, big usability win (I hope!).
<img loading="lazy" src="/posts/hugonest_blog_enhancements_navigation__file_movement/cut.png"></p>
<p>On top of that, I circled back to the file management side of things. Remember how you could upload and view files? Well, now you can actually MOVE them! üéâ It sounds basic, but it&rsquo;s a crucial step for proper organization. No more clunky workarounds if you decide a file belongs in a different folder. Just drag it (or, well, use the &lsquo;move&rsquo; command) and boom, it&rsquo;s there. Still more to do on the file manager, but this felt like a necessary piece to get in place.
<img loading="lazy" src="/posts/hugonest_blog_enhancements_navigation__file_movement/cut2.png"></p>
<p>Making steady progress and ticking things off the list! Always feels good.</p>
<p>As always, I&rsquo;m building this out in the open, so your feedback is gold. How&rsquo;s the blog experience shaping up for you? Any specific file management tools you&rsquo;re hoping for next? Hit me up in the comments!</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

      <title>HUGONEST: Dark Mode &amp; GitHub Login Integration Now Available!</title>
      <link>https://hugonest.pages.dev/posts/hugonest_dark_mode__github_login_integration_now_available/</link>

      <description>Exciting updates to HUGO nest! We&amp;#39;ve just launched Dark Mode with system-wide syncing and integrated GitHub login for a smoother user experience. Learn more and share your feedback below!</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey everyone!</p>
<p>Hope you&rsquo;re all doing great. Just wanted to share what I&rsquo;ve been hammering away at for HUGONEST over the past day or so. Been focused on a couple of features I know folks have been asking for (or will appreciate!).</p>
<p>First up, HUGE news for all you night owls (and anyone who just digs a sleeker look): Dark Mode is officially in! üåô Spent a good chunk of time getting this dialed in. The best part? It&rsquo;s not just an on/off switch ‚Äì I made sure it hooks into your system settings. So, if your OS flips to dark mode at sunset, HUGONEST will follow right along. Of course, you&rsquo;ll still have the option to manually set it if that&rsquo;s more your style. Pretty stoked about how this turned out visually.
<img loading="lazy" src="/posts/hugonest_dark_mode__github_login_integration_now_available/dark1.png"></p>
<p>Also managed to knock out GitHub login integration. üí™ Been wanting to add more convenient ways to get you guys logged in, and GitHub felt like a natural fit for a lot of potential users. Should make hopping into HUGONEST a bit smoother for those of you already living in the GitHub ecosystem.
<img loading="lazy" src="/posts/hugonest_dark_mode__github_login_integration_now_available/dark2.png"></p>
<p>Felt like a super productive session! Getting these foundational pieces and user comfort features in place feels really good.</p>
<p>What do you guys think? Excited for Dark Mode? Any other login methods you&rsquo;re dying to see? Let me know below!

<p>Catch ya later,</p>
