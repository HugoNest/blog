Five years ago, I was just another dev working a stable but boring job, building stuff I didn’t care about.

One day, a friend messaged me:  
> “Yo, you heard of Hugo? Static site generator. Fast as hell. Uses Markdown.”

I checked it out.  
And it hit me—this is what I *actually* wanna build for. Clean tools. No bloat. Full control.  
So I quit my job to make something of my own.

A few months later, I launched **HugoNest**—a mobile app for Hugo users.  
You can write blogs on your phone, sync with Git, and even use AI to help you start your posts.  
No laptop needed. No distractions. Just you and your ideas.

But real talk?  
It flopped.

Barely any downloads. I couldn’t even pay my server bill.  
People told me to quit. Get a real job. Do consulting.  
I almost gave up.

Then I saw this comment on GitHub from a dev in South Africa:

> “Wrote my travel blog on the bus using HugoNest. No laptop. Just my phone. Thank you.”

That message? Man… it kept me going.

I realized HugoNest isn't for the masses.  
It’s for people like us—indie makers, devs, bloggers who wanna own their work, build without limits, and stay off the big platforms.

So I made one final decision:

**I made HugoNest 100% free.**

Not because it’s worthless.  
But because I believe in it.  
And I believe someone out there still needs it.

If you use Hugo, or you just wanna write your story your way—this is for you.

I don’t know if this will save the app.  
But I know this:

**Before I walk away, I want to give it to the ones who truly get it.**
