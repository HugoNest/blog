Hi everyone!

If you use Hugo for your blog, like me, and sometimes wish it was easier to do simple things on your phone, then maybe you'll find this interesting.

I've been working on a small tool that I hope will help Hugo users manage their blogs easier on their phones. Right now, it's in the very early testing stages, but I think some of you might like the idea.

Basically, this tool (let's call it HugoNest for now) wants to make it simpler to manage your Hugo blog on your phone, so you don't always need a computer. It can do a few basic things like:

* **Work on different phones and computers.**
* **Help with simple Git stuff.**
* **Make it easier to write in Markdown on your phone.**
* **Have some new AI features to help you write.**
* **Make it easy to add pictures from your phone.**
* **Show changes in the app quickly.**

I know that for a tool like Hugo, being stable and keeping your data safe is super important. That's why I've thought about these things from the start (like keeping your keys safe on your phone).

Right now, I'm doing a small test with a few people. I'd really like to get some real feedback to help make this tool better. If you also use Hugo and are willing to spend a little time trying out this early version and give me your thoughts, I would really appreciate it!

As a thank you for helping me test, if you join our early testing group, you will **get to use this app for free.**

**If you're interested in joining the test, please send me an email or a message with your email address.** I will use your email to add you to the list of testers on Google Play.

My email address is:  HugoNest@xgdebug.com

 
I'm really excited to see how we can make using Hugo even better together!

Thanks a lot!
