Every Hugo( or Jekyll) website owner has likely experienced the charm of its efficiency and simplicity. However, when it comes to updating, modifying, or even managing website content in mobile scenarios, that convenience often takes a significant hit. As we discussed earlier, directly operating a Hugo website on a mobile phone faces numerous insurmountable obstacles:

* **Lack of a Proper Development Environment:** Mobile operating systems are not designed for software development, making it awkward to run a static site generator like Hugo that relies on command-line tools and specific environments.
* **Limited Command-Line Access:** Even with the existence of some terminal emulators, their functionality is far inferior to desktop environments, making it incredibly difficult to execute Hugo's complex commands.
* **Complex File System Management:** Navigating and editing the directory structure, Markdown files, and configuration files of a Hugo website on a small phone screen is undoubtedly a nightmare.
* **Difficult-to-Manage Dependencies:** Hugo may rely on Go language environments and other tools that are challenging to install and maintain on mobile devices.
* **Cumbersome Deployment Process:** Website deployment typically involves Git version control and various command-line tools, making the efficiency and convenience of operating on a mobile device difficult to guarantee.

These pain points force us to rely on desktop computers to complete Hugo website management tasks, which undoubtedly limits our freedom to update content anytime, anywhere. Whenever inspiration strikes, we want to quickly fix typos, or simply want to manage the website while traveling, we feel helpless.
