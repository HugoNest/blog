Ayo, what’s good Hugo gang! Man, I been tired after this weekend, fr—been locked in grindin’ on HugoNest (that’s my app, ya know, the one that lets you run ya whole Hugo site from ya phone, no cap). But yo, I got some fire updates I just dropped, so listen up!

First off—GitHub login finally workin’ right! And it auto-sets up ya repo and everything! Bruh, this gonna save so many headaches, especially if you new to this Hugo stuff. Before, you had to do all this extra ish, now? One tap, boom, you in. No stress.

Oh, and the app fast as hell now—like, no more laggin’ when you typin’ or tryna load stuff. Had to rewrite a whole chunk of the code to fix that mess, but it’s smooth like butter now, on God.

Editor got upgrades too! That Front Matter thing? Yeah, it was lowkey confusing before, but now you can add ya own fields easy, plus there’s lil’ tips so you ain’t sittin’ there guessin’ what to do.

UI lookin’ cleaner too—and yo, we got Japanese now! 日本語, ya feel me? For all my folks out in Tokyo or wherever.
