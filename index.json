And whenever this topic comes up, you always hear about the Markdown editor being clunky, or wrestling with getting changes synced and committed via Git on mobile.\nAnd yeah, those can be annoying, but honestly? That\u0026rsquo;s not the main headache for me.\nThe absolute worst part, the thing that really makes it a pain, is trying to wrestle with all that Markdown syntax on that little phone keyboard. Especially when you need to drop in an image or a link.\nTrying to type out ![alt text](image-url.jpg) or [link text](http://url.com) with all the brackets, parentheses, finding the right keys, making sure the syntax is just right\u0026hellip; it totally breaks my flow. I feel like I\u0026rsquo;m doing surgery on a postage stamp. It\u0026rsquo;s so hard to just type freely and quickly when you have to constantly stop and think about formatting syntax.\nWhat I really wish I could do is just type naturally, like I\u0026rsquo;m sending a text to a friend. Just get my thoughts down without caring about strict Markdown rules in the moment.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s my thought: What if I could just dump my plain text draft into something (an app? a tool?), and then hit a button, and some smart AI figures out where the links/images should go based on context or simple cues, and formats it into correct Markdown?\nLike, the AI only does the formatting. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t write the content at all. It just takes my free-form text and adds the [](), #, *, etc., where they belong.\nDoes anyone else struggle with this specific part of mobile static site writing? Am I missing some obvious trick? What are your workflows?\nCurious to hear your thoughts!\nUPDATE: So, I actually found something that seems to do exactly this! It\u0026rsquo;s called HugoNest It lets me just type naturally on my phone without worrying about the exact Markdown syntax, and then it uses AI to handle the formatting automatically afterwards. This seriously feels like it solves the main pain point I was having.

However, when it comes to updating, modifying, or even managing website content in mobile scenarios, that convenience often takes a significant hit. As we discussed earlier, directly operating a Hugo website on a mobile phone faces numerous insurmountable obstacles:\nLack of a Proper Development Environment: Mobile operating systems are not designed for software development, making it awkward to run a static site generator like Hugo that relies on command-line tools and specific environments. Limited Command-Line Access: Even with the existence of some terminal emulators, their functionality is far inferior to desktop environments, making it incredibly difficult to execute Hugo\u0026rsquo;s complex commands. Complex File System Management: Navigating and editing the directory structure, Markdown files, and configuration files of a Hugo website on a small phone screen is undoubtedly a nightmare. Difficult-to-Manage Dependencies: Hugo may rely on Go language environments and other tools that are challenging to install and maintain on mobile devices. Cumbersome Deployment Process: Website deployment typically involves Git version control and various command-line tools, making the efficiency and convenience of operating on a mobile device difficult to guarantee. These pain points force us to rely on desktop computers to complete Hugo website management tasks, which undoubtedly limits our freedom to update content anytime, anywhere. Whenever inspiration strikes, we want to quickly fix typos, or simply want to manage the website while traveling, we feel helpless.\nNow, we are delighted to introduce HugoNest, a cross-platform Hugo website management tool specifically designed to solve these pain points!\nHugoNest was born to break free from the desktop constraints of Hugo website management, allowing you to easily manage your Hugo blog from your phone, anytime, anywhere.

Previously, I used various methods to update my blog, but all of them required a PC.\nPC Method VSCODE+Github My initial approach was to edit in VSCODE, generate static files in the Public directory locally using the Hugo command, and then submit them to Github Pages for direct publication. Later, I found the Hugo generation process too cumbersome, so I switched to editing and directly submitting to Github, then using Github Actions to generate blog files and publish them to Github Pages.\nSince all images on this site are hosted on Github, and due to the well-known issues with the speed of accessing Github Pages, I eventually abandoned the Github Actions + Github Pages solution in favor of automatic deployment through Vercel or Cloudflare Pages.\nObsidian+Github Obsidian is an excellent note-taking software with a very large plugin library. With Obsidian + quickadd plugin + Git plugin, it‚Äôs very convenient to directly submit blog posts to Github from Obsidian. However, the issue is that Obsidian can only publish article content and cannot modify other site settings. Managing the Posts directory of Hugo directly with Obsidian feels odd, and unless a dedicated blog repository is created, there‚Äôs a constant risk of confusing note content with blog content during the management process.\nJoplin+Github Joplin is also a very good open-source note-taking software. Although Joplin has fewer plugins, there is one that can directly publish to Github Pages, called Pages Publisher Pages Publisher. However, this plugin is used by fewer people and currently only offers a very basic blog theme.\nNevertheless, all these methods inevitably require the use of a PC.\nMobile Method Github Code Github repositories allow for direct creation and modification of files. However, the inconvenience with this method is that direct access to Github from within China is not always reliable. The worst scenario is editing halfway through, only to have the page reset due to network issues. Github Codespaces faces the same issue.\nWeblog App Weblog is an Android app that supports managing Hugo and HEXO blogs on mobile devices. It includes built-in Hugo and Hexo environments and Git, allowing for convenient blog setup, static file generation, and webpage previews on the phone. It can easily publish to Github via Git. However, due to Hexo‚Äôs lower efficiency, it is recommended to use it with Hugo. The main issue with this solution is that it only supports creating MD files and does not allow uploading photos within the app. To upload photos, one must use the Android‚Äôs native file manager or a third-party file management tool.\nMgit App Mgit is an Android Git application that easily pulls Github repositories to the local device, allowing for blog writing with a third-party Markdown editor. Many people use Obsidian as their blog editor and sync between their phone and computer using Mgit. The downside is that Mgit seems to have not been updated for a long time, and I encountered an issue on my Vivo X100 phone where I couldn‚Äôt edit files directly within Mgit.\nStackEdit Stackedit is an excellent online Markdown editor that can be privately deployed and linked to Github repositories, with information stored in browser Cookies. I‚Äôve tried editing simple information on my phone through Stackedit and submitting updates to Github. The main drawback of this method is that it cannot submit images, making it suitable only for situations where no images are needed or when using a third-party image library.\nHaving suffered significant setbacks with image libraries since 2008, and upon cleaning up my Wordpress blog in 2018, I found that nearly 500 out of 900 images on the site had been lost due to issues with external image libraries. Even self-built image libraries have left me lacking confidence. Managing them separately always feels prone to problems.\nHugoNest Finally, the current best choice is HugoNest. It\u0026rsquo;s a cross-platform app (Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, Windows) that lets you update your Hugo blog anytime, anywhere.
